Pyalmanac 
=========

Pyalmanac is a Python script that creats the daaily pages of the
Nautical Almanac. These are tabels that are needed for selestial
navigation with a Sekstant. Normally these tables must be bought every
year as a Book. This little program is trying to do away with this
inconveniance. Most of the heavy computing is done by the free Pyephem
libraries. Typesetting is done by TeX/LaTeX So before you can use this
program you net to install:

Python v2.x (2.6 or later ) python 3 will not work out of the box
